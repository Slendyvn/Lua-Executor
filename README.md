# Some information
**This is a keyless executor with simple ui, suitable for exploiting if ur computer is weak**
1. I dont download any nuggets or suspicious files, everything is already in the Visual Studio 2022 Toolbox
2. this project is meant to be light with only 8.8mb
3. this is my hobby and this is not a rat or trojan or whatever. if you dont trust this then dont download it
4. I dont need any support call me skid or whatever idc
5. its calling you tester because this is actually the test version made for testers

# Important stuff
**It will create a new .txt file everytime you inject**
- .txt files cant harm your computer , everytime you inject it will create a .txt file / it use to identity what script do you use and stuff
- ofc you can delete it, just go to the logs foler in net8.0 folder
- you can reinstall the executor like normal but heres some extra steps to save some data
1. window + R -> appdata
2. go to Local
3. find Xeno -> Delete it or save it for your next use idc
